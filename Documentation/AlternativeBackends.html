    <h1>Alternative OPC-UA back-ends for quasar</h1>
    <br>
    Here, the term "OPC-UA back-end" refers to a piece of software,
    which provides an API compatible with the Unified Automation C++ SDK
    (note not all features of the UA API are actually used in quasar).<br>
    <br>
    Quasar supports multiple OPC-UA back-ends.<br>
    <br>
    As of June 2016, the following backends are supported in quasar:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><a
href="https://www.unified-automation.com/products/server-sdk/c-ua-server-sdk.html">The
          UA C++ SDK</a>, version 1.3.x, 1.4.x, 1.5.x. <br>
        Note that you can use the evaluation version of the UA C++ SDK
        in case you don't have the regular license.<br>
        Note this back-end works directly in quasar and we don't support
        any further instructions.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The <a href="https://open62541.org/">open62541</a> used
        through <a
          href="https://github.com/quasar-team/open62541-compat/">open62541-compat</a><br>
        Read below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Using open62541 (open-source OPC-UA stack)<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The open62541 is a C-based OPC-UA stack and on its own it can't
      be used as a back-end for Quasar.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, the Quasar team has created a compatibility layer
      which lets use open62541 in quasar projects. The compatibility
      layer is quickly available to quasar developers as one of
      supported "optional modules".<br>
    </p>
    <p>In order to configure your quasar project to use the open62541,
      follow the steps (it is assumed you already have a quasar
      project):<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Enable open62541-compat in your project<br>
        ./quasar.py enable_module open62541-compat<br>
        ./quasar.py prepare_build open62541_config.cmake<br>
      </li>
      <li>Prepare open62541-compat (it will download and compile
        open62541)<br>
        cd open62541-compat/<br>
        python prepare.py<br>
        cd ..<br>
      </li>
      <li>Run the build:<br>
        ./quasar.py build open62541_config.cmake<br>
        In case build fails, do:<br>
        ./quasar.py clean<br>
        ./quasar.py build open62541_config.cmake<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><br>
      Note that you <b>need</b> to supply the build config file
      (open62541_config.cmake) as an argument to "./quasar.py build".
      The file informs the quasar builder to use open62541. </p>
