<h1>LogIt</h1>
Logging in quasar is handled by the LogIt component. For instructions on how to use LogIt generally, i.e. how to log specific messages from a quasar server please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/quasar-team/LogIt">LogIt repository</a>. 

<h1>Configuring LogIt in a Quasar Server</h1>
As described above, the general means of logging via LogIt is documented <a href="https://github.com/quasar-team/LogIt">here</a>. However, you will need to configure LogIt in your quasar server - this section describes the hooks etc. provided by quasar where you, the developer, are expected to insert configuration code.
<br><br>
Please read about <a href="https://github.com/quasar-team/LogIt#components">LogIt components</a>. It's not long or complicated and you need to know about them.
<br><br>
Presumably, the quasar server you write will perform tasks at runtime relating to different aspects. Examples may include accepting input (e.g. handling OPC-UA client item writes and method calls), sending commands to hardware (e.g. calling some 3rd party API) and handling disconnection/reconnection. The general idea of LogIt components is that each aspect has a dedicated logging component, the benefit of this is that LogIt allows you to raise and lower the logging <a href="https://github.com/quasar-team/LogIt#verbosity">verbosity</a>a> of components at runtime in order to tune your server's logging according to the aspect you are interested in.
<br><br>
Note: You, the quasar server developer, defines the components and decides whether log messages are considered TRACE, WARNING etc.
<br><br>
<h2>To Configure LogIt in a quasar server</h2>
The class QuasarServer is created in your project with a hook method for you to override with the LogIt component IDs specific to your server.

Note that LogIt is its own independent component (it is used outside of quasar). So, the quasar repository does not have
